            <h3>Albus Dumbledore</h3>
            <p>Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore (1881-1997) was one of the most powerful and respected wizards of his time, renowned for his wisdom, 
                compassion, and extraordinary magical skill. He served as Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he became a mentor 
                to generations of young witches and wizards, including Harry Potter.</p>
            <p>Dumbledore was instrumental in resisting both of Lord Voldemort's rises to power. As founder of the Order of the Phoenix, he guided the fight 
                against the Dark Lord while uncovering crucial secrets about Horcruxes. Though admired for his brilliance, Dumbledore carried personal burdens, 
                including the tragic story of his family and his youthful ties with Gellert Grindelwald, which shaped his later pursuit of justice and equality.</p>
            <p>He died in 1997 during the events of the Second Wizarding War, leaving behind a lasting legacy as a defender of hope, knowledge, and love.</p>
