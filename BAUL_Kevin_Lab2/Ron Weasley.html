            <h3>Ron Weasley</h3>
            <p>Ronald Bilius Weasley (b. March 1, 1980) is a pure-blood wizard and the sixth son of Arthur and Molly Weasley. He grew up in the Burrow 
                alongside his five brothers and younger sister, Ginny. At Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Ron was sorted into Gryffindor 
                and quickly became best friends with Harry Potter and Hermione Granger, forming the famous trio that played a crucial role in the downfall 
                of Lord Voldemort.</p>
            <p>Known for his loyalty, bravery, and sense of humor, Ron often struggled with feelings of inadequacy compared to his siblings and friends 
                but consistently proved himself in moments of great danger. He was a key member of Dumbledore's Army, fought in the Battle of Hogwarts, 
                and later became an Auror before joining his brother George in managing Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes.</p>
            <p>Ron eventually married Hermione Granger, and together they had two children, Rose and Hugo Weasley.</p>
