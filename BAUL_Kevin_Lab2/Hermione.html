            <h3>Hermione Granger</h3>
            <p>Hermione Jean Granger (b. September 19, 1979) is a Muggle-born witch who became one of the most gifted students at Hogwarts School of 
                Witchcraft and Wizardry. Sorted into Gryffindor, she quickly distinguished herself through intelligence, diligence, and a strong sense of justice.</p>
            <p>She formed a close friendship with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley, becoming part of the trio that played a central role in the defeat of Lord 
                Voldemort. A founding member of Dumbledoreâ€™s Army, Hermione contributed crucial knowledge and resourcefulness to their efforts, from brewing 
                Polyjuice Potion to deciphering Horcruxes.</p>
            <p>After the Second Wizarding War, Hermione pursued a career at the Ministry of Magic, working first to improve the treatment of magical 
                creatures and later serving as Minister for Magic. She married Ron Weasley, and together they had two children, Rose and Hugo Weasley.</p>
