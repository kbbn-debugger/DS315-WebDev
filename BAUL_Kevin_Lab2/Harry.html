            <h3>Harry Potter</h3>
            <p>Harry James Potter is the central character of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. Born on July 31, 1980, to James and Lily Potter, 
                he became known in the wizarding world as “The Boy Who Lived” after surviving an attack by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, which left him 
                with a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead. Orphaned as an infant, Harry was raised by his unkind relatives, the Dursleys, until he 
                discovered his magical heritage at the age of eleven.</p>
            <p>He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he was sorted into Gryffindor House and formed close friendships with 
                Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley. Throughout his years at Hogwarts, Harry repeatedly faced Voldemort and his followers, uncovering the 
                truth about his own connection to the Dark Lord.</p>
            <p>Harry is known for his courage, loyalty, and strong sense of justice. He ultimately played a decisive role in the defeat of Voldemort 
                during the Battle of Hogwarts, fulfilling a prophecy that tied their fates together. After the war, Harry went on to become an Auror 
                and later Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. He married Ginny Weasley, with whom he had three children.</p>
